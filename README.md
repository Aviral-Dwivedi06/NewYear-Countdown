# New Year Countdown Timer

The New Year Countdown Timer is a responsive, real-time web component that displays the remaining time until the start of the upcoming calendar year. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the timer continuously updates the days, hours, minutes, and seconds left, providing a precise and user-friendly countdown experience.

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `Date` object, mathematical time conversions, and dynamic DOM manipulation. Its minimal dependencies and clean structure make it suitable for integration into seasonal websites, promotional pages, or standalone use.
